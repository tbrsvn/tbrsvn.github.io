title: "Toma's Review Of: The Death of Stalin (2017)"
subtitle:
description: "Director: Armando Iannucci | Writer(s): Fabien Nury, Thierry Robin, Armando Iannucci | Stars: 
Steve Buscemi, Simon Russell Beale, Jeffrey Tambor. In early-1953 Moscow, under the Great Terror's heavy cloak of state paranoia, the ever-watchful Soviet leader, Iosif Stalin, collapses, unexpectedly, of a brain haemorrhage. As a result, when someone discovers his body the following morning, a frenetic surge of raw panic starts spreading like a virus amongst the senior members of the Council of Ministers, as they scramble to maintain order, weed out the competition, and, ultimately, take power. But, in the middle of a gut-wrenching roller-coaster of incessant plotting, tireless machinations, and frail allegiances, absolutely no one is safe; not even the feared chief of the secret police, Lavrenti Beria. In the end, who will prevail after the death of Stalin?"

# Short Summary Of My Review

The Death of Stalin is a hilarious movie using both comedic wit and normalized excessive violence to tell a (suprisingly) historically accurate story. It has beautiful camera work, music, and has turned me onto Armando Iannucci as a director. I don't need another director to deep dive, so for that I'm giving the movie (1)0/10.

# Full Review

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Death of Stalin has a brand of comedy I've never seen before. It's very smart and a lot of jokes have multi-scene setup, but then there are also random one liners that aren't nearly as setup but equally funny. So easily saying "go kill them" with no affect when three people see you dragging a dead body is somehow funny. It's able to stay funny in this violence because it's not very gory. The most gory part (opening Stalin's head) isn't related to killing. This small bit of gore combined with a totally removed view from the people of Russia of the main characters gives a "this happens a lot, so it doesn't matter" view of the murders of civilians in this movie, allowing it to remove the sad factor and just be very funny.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It also has amazing directing. You can tell every shot was thought about for 10 hours and then scrapped when Iannucci got an even better idea to ponder. The shots of the ginormous fortresses these soviet leaders had were beautiful. The music fit every scene perfectly, elevating but never distracting from them. The scenes with *tons* of people had me questioning how he had that, which is the magic in movies. "How did you do that?" is probably the best compliment you can receive. On top of all that, the runtime is under two hours so it moves very fast. Iannucci more like Imadeagoodmovieucci, 10/10
