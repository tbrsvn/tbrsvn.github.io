title: "Toma's Review Of: Barton Fink (1991)"
subtitle:
description: "Director: Joel Coen, Ethan Coen | Writer(s): Joel Coen, Ethan Coen | Stars: John Turturro, John Goodman, Judy Davis. In the wake of his early but undeniable theatrical success in Broadway, the idealistic author of the proletariat and self-pitying 1940s New York playwright, Barton Fink, finds himself lured to dazzling Hollywood to write scripts for eccentric Jack Lipnick's Capitol Pictures. But, instead of writing a story pivoting around the common man, Fink's first screenplay turns out to be a Wallace Beery wrestling movie, and, before he knows it, he develops a severe case of writer's block. Now, holed up in the seedy, run-down Hotel Earle, before his silent Underwood typewriter, Barton comes to realise that his only hope to meet the deadline is to take inspiration from the burly insurance salesman living next door, Charlie Meadows, and the unassuming secretary, Audrey Taylor. In the meantime, the suffocating stranglehold of artistic bankruptcy tightens. Does self-destructive Barton Fink have the stomach for confronting Hollywood's bitter reality?"

# Short Summary Of My Review

Barton Fink is the Coen brothers best work. You can tell that it was a spur of the moment thing, and that makes it so raw and human to watch. I even liked Buscemi in it, 10/10.

# Full Review

Barton Fink has amazing acting, a story full of symbols, and *JOHN FRICKIN' GOODMAN*. The most amazing part of Barton Fink is it can be as deep or as shallow as you want -- and all the interpretations are right (In typical Coen brother fashion, ie Miller's Crossing). John Turturro is amazing, like always, and is really believable in this role. His character slowly reveals how spoiled he is, but even then there's no definite he's good or bad. The box never being opened is amazing, and leaves the plot in a beautiful kind of solved kind of not that I love. The movie producer is also super funny. The way he talks is just so interesting and unlike anything else I've seen before. The ending is super crazy and sudden in normal Coen brother fashion. John Goodman is clearly a little bit off from the start, but you put your guard down with Barton Fink because he just seems like a weird dude. There's so much more to this movie that I don't have answers for, like the ending on the beach being the same as in the picture, and I think that's awesome. I really like this movie and the Coen brothers in general. 10/10.
