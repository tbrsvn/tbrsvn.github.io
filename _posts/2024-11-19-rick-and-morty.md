# Short Summary Of My Review

Rick and Morty is one of my favorite shows, and it was the show the introduced me to adult comedy. Justin Roiland has a very special brand of humor, and it is sad how his situation turned out as now the show is much, *much* worse. 9/10

# Full Review

Rick and Morty has a special place in my heart that can never be replaced. Family Guy, South Park and Robot Chicken have tried but they all don't hit the same comedy buzzers in my brain. Robot Chicken is probably the closest, but I can't put my finger on why. Anyway, The very formulaic, sit-com style dynamic of Rick and Morty going on dangerous, inter-galactic adventures where the annoying older sister, over-protective mom, and stupid dad hinder them in some way, and then after every episode they are fine, is great. And it's like that until season 4, where a greater plot starts developing of evil Morty and Rick's past life. These have permanent changes to the plot, unlike the non-permanent, episodic changes of the past seasons. The keeps building, and the end of season 5 is so good it made me cry. That monologue by Mr. Poopy Butthole (this will sound so weird if you haven't seen Rick and Morty) is some of the best script writing I've ever seen. The cliff-hanger on season 6 is great, and the plot for the rest of the series is set out. Then season 7 comes. There's a total tonal shift in how the story is delivered, no more comedy, and Rick doesn't actually develop that much. Roiland has that very special drunk, stutter-y comedy that is impossible to get without him. Without that, and with the new plot line, it's impossible for it to be funny. I think for the show to find new viewers and become funny again (of course, in a different way) they would have to drop the greater plot for a bit to just focus on getting the sit-com part down. But instead they B-line the plot, which I guess is easier, but then why doesn't Rick have any character development? He just switches how he expresses his deep sadness into not drunken funny but depressed. That could work for a different audience, and I'm sure it does, but for people who were there because they want the Roiland comedy, the show is a burger now. Kicking Roiland off definitely was the right decision though. He shouldn't get a pass for being famous. 9/10, I wish we were in the non-rapey Roiland multiverse
